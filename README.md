# Movie-Seat-Selector
The Movie Seat Selector is a responsive web application that allows users to visually select and reserve seats for a movie.
It dynamically updates the total cost based on the number of selected seats and the movie selected. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface and stores user preferences in the browser using localStorage.
